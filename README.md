MunicipleServiceApp README
The application has been submitted via a compressed ZIP file and on GitHub, We are going to be running through how to open the application 
through the compressed zip file.
Once the compressed ZIP file has been downloaded, right click and extract all files which will allow the user to open the application through 
visual studios.
The user will be greeted by a home page which will have 3 options, due to two of our features coming out soon you will only be able to choose 
report issues, once you have clicked report issues you will the be redirected to that page.
Once you are on that page you will be able to enter a location, category, description, you can also attach a file or picture, once you have 
filled in all fields you will then be allowed to submit which will make the progress bar go up and the flower will grow with each submission.

Local Events has now been implemented.
Once the user is on the local events window they will have the option to choose a Category and choose a specific date out of all the events listed.
When the user has found their desired event they can then click the search button which will then display all events listed in the chosen category.
If the user cannot find their desired event they may click the recommendations button which will recommend the user events based on their previous searches.
